                <p>
                    Hello! I am Mackenzie Heath and I am from Shelley, Idaho. I am majoring in 
                    Web Design and Development and I am working on recieving a Bachelor's Degree
                    at BYUI. In my free time I love to play the violin and viola and spend time 
                    with my family. I love the outdoors and will spend as much time as I can being 
                    outside. There are 6 people in my family and I am the oldest of 4 kids. I also have
                    a dog named Sherlock and a beta fish named Watson. My favorite book series is The Mortal
                    Instruments and my favorite movie is Back to the Future. My favorite food is Mexican but I 
                    also like Itallian and Chinese food. My favorite color is yellow but I really like sunset
                    colors. I also really like to travel. I haven't been outside of the United States but I've
                    been to Washington, Hawaii, Wyoming, California, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, and Montana. I hope
                    to one day be able to visit every state along with going outside the country.
                </p>
